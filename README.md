- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Claudibunsen
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mostly interested in film-based photography and such, 3-d printing, and random odds and ends.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to keep an up-to-date version of the SKR-E3-DIP config files, modified for use on the Creality Ender 5;
 preconfigured for use with TMC2209 stepper drivers, as the set-up of it, is a gigantuan nightmare.
 
 - i'm also a Non-Binary Person, using fem-pronouns (she/her)
 - i have ADHD Type-C, so my specialty is being scatterbrained and hypertalkative, but mostly about photography and stuff; and uhhh...
 - i tend to be unfiltered and stuff.
 - i also have a zero of proper experience in coding, so i mostly just duck around a bit, but... we shouldnt talk about that  too much :x

- that being said; i suck at doing this, so please do not scold me, if your printer happens to catch fire, or suddenly happens to become sentient.
 i'm just trying to make life a teensy bit easier for everyone, as its enough of a headache without help.
